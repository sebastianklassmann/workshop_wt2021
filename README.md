# workshop_wt2021

Welcome to our workshop concluding the seminar "Computational Music Cognition" (winter term 20/21) at the University of Cologne.

We will be using this repository for exchanging materials, such as notebooks during and in between sessions. As we progress, I will make this repository private and grant participants of our workshop write access so we can easily exchange ideas, code and reading materials.
